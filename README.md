## Overview

The **Hospital Appointment Scheduler** is a system designed to simplify the process of booking medical appointments.  
Patients can specify their symptoms or required specialization (e.g., _cardiology_, _surgery_), and the system will automatically:

- Match them with an available doctor in the required specialization.
- Find the **nearest available appointment slot** based on doctor availability and workload.
- Ensure efficient **time management** by considering appointment duration and patient load.

This project aims to reduce waiting times, improve scheduling efficiency, and enhance the overall patient experience in hospitals or clinics.
